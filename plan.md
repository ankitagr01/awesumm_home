## 📝 Notes

- **Backend-First Approach:** All business logic lives in Django
- **Frontend Role:** Data presentation and user interaction only
- **Placeholder Content:** Use placeholder avatars and sample data during development
- **Database Schema:** Will be provided separately for Supabase profiles table
- **No UI Libraries:** Keep it simple with basic HTML/CSS for now

**Total Estimated Development Time:** 2-3 weeks (depending on experience level)  
**Priority:** Focus on core functionality first, polish later
